# Tauri PDF Annotation App - Unrelated Files Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a Tauri v2 application with React Vite frontend that has been adapted from a template to create a PDF annotation tool. The original template was designed for general desktop applications but now focuses specifically on PDF annotation functionality.

## Related Files (Core Functionality)
These files are directly related to the PDF annotation functionality:

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/editor/` - Main PDF editor components
- `src/services/pdf.ts` - PDF service layer
- `src/types/pdf.ts` - PDF-related types
- `src/components/layout/MainWindowContent.tsx` - Main layout component

### Backend (Rust)
- `src-tauri/src/pdf.rs` - PDF handling functionality
- `src-tauri/src/collections.rs` - Collections management
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Main Tauri application setup and command handlers
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Application configuration

### Data Management
- `src-tauri/src/state.rs` - Shared application state
- Various JSON files for storing PDF data, strokes, thumbnails, etc.

## Unrelated Files (Template Artifacts)
These files are remnants from the original template and are not directly related to PDF annotation functionality:

### Documentation
- `docs/developer/` - General developer documentation that isn't specific to PDF annotations
  - `docs/developer/architectural-patterns.md`
  - `docs/developer/architecture-guide.md`
  - `docs/developer/auto-updates.md`
  - `docs/developer/bundle-optimization.md`
  - `docs/developer/command-system.md`
  - `docs/developer/data-persistence.md`
  - `docs/developer/keyboard-shortcuts.md`
  - `docs/developer/logging.md`
  - `docs/developer/menus.md`
  - `docs/developer/notifications.md`
  - `docs/developer/performance-patterns.md`
  - `docs/developer/releases.md`
  - `docs/developer/state-management.md`
  - `docs/developer/testing.md`
- `docs/userguide/` - General user guide not specific to PDF annotation
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines for the template
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Getting started guide for the template
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security documentation for the template
- `docs/SECURITY_PRODUCTION.md` - Production security guidelines for the template
- `docs/tasks.md` - Task management documentation for the template
- `docs/template-requirements.md` - Template requirements documentation

### Scripts and Build Tools
- `scripts/prepare-release.js` - Release preparation script for the template

### Other Files
- `src-tauri/src-tauri/` - Rust project structure files not used in PDF functionality
- `.claude/agents/` - AI development assistants specific to the template
- `public/` directory - Static assets that may not be needed for PDF annotation only
- Various configuration files in root directory that are not PDF-specific

### Unused Components and Services
- `src/services/collections.ts` - Collections functionality (may be related but not core PDF annotation)
- Files in `src/components/` that aren't used by the PDF editor
- Test files (`src/**/*.test.tsx`, `src-tauri/**/*.rs`) that don't relate to PDF functionality

## Recommendations
1. Remove documentation files that are not relevant to PDF annotation
2. Clean up unused components and services
3. Keep only essential configuration and build scripts needed for the PDF annotation app
4. Consider renaming or reorganizing the project structure to be more focused on PDF annotation
