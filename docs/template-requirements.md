# Tauri + React App "Walking Skeleton"

## Introduction

This document contains detils for creating a "walking skeleton" for building robust, maintainable, and scalable desktop applications using Tauri and React. The goal is to establish a clear, modern, and opinionated project structure and architecture _before_ writing the first feature.

This setup is designed to be highly effective for human developers and AI coding agents alike. It promotes best practices, separation of concerns, and provides clear instructions and patterns to follow, reducing ambiguity and leading to a higher-quality codebase.

# Core Tech Stack

- Base: Tauri 2, React 19+ & Typescript, Rust
- UI: Tailwind 4 & Shadcn 4
- State: Tanstack Query & Zustand 5
- Tests: Built-in for Rust & Vitest 3 for TS
- CI & Releases: GitHub Actions + GitHub
- DX: VSCode/Cursor, Claude Code

## App Boilerplate (Tauri & React)

App scaffolding is created with `npm create tauri-app@latest -- --template react-ts` , producing a basic directory structure. Other directories are added to provide a basic structure:

```
/
├── public/                  # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── assets/              # Fonts, images, etc.
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── layout/          # Main layout components (MainWindow, TitleBar, LeftSidebar, RightSidebar, MainWindowContent)
|   |   |── command-palette/ # Command pallete components
|   |   |── preferences/     # Preferences Dialog components
│   │   └── ui/              # Shadcn-ui components
│   ├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
│   ├── lib/                 # Core utilities, helpers, and command system
|       └── commands/        # Command system
│   ├── services/            # The API layer (TanStack Query + Tauri invoke)
│   ├── store/               # Zustand stores for global UI state
│   ├── test/                # Tests
│   └── types/               # Shared TypeScript types
├── src-tauri/               # Rust backend
└── ... (config files)
```

A sensible `.gitignore` file for Tauri projects which also ignores all files with `.local` in their filenames.

### VSCode Settings

These settings allow VSCode or Cursor to play nicely with the stuff that will be installed later.

#### `.vscode/extensions.json`

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "tauri-apps.tauri-vscode",
    "rust-lang.rust-analyzer",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
    "tailwindlabs.tailwindcss-intellisense",
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin"
  ]
}
```

#### `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "css.lint.unknownAtRules": "ignore",
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
    "html": "html",
    "javascript": "javascript",
    "css": "css"
  },
  "files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
  }
}
```

### Clipboard Manager

The Tauri [Clipboard Manager plugin](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/clipboard/) is installed and configured.

## Linting, Checks & Formatting

- Typescript, ESLint, Prettier, Clippy & Cargo Formatter
- Sensible Tauri-friendly default configs for ESLint, Prettier and Typescript. Ensure `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`, and `src-tauri/rustfmt.toml` are configured with sensible defaults to enforce a consistent code style.
- Suitable commands added to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ... other scripts
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
  "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
  "format:check": "prettier --check \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,css,md}\"",
  "rust:fmt:check": "cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check",
  "rust:clippy": "cd src-tauri && cargo clippy -- -D warnings",
  "rust:test": "cd src-tauri && cargo test",
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:run": "vitest run",
  "check:all": "npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run test:run && npm run rust:fmt:check && npm run rust:clippy && npm run rust:test"
},
```

## State Management

### Local Component State -> `useState`

State that is only relevant to a single component (e.g., the value of an input field, whether a dropdown is open) uses the standard React `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.

### Global UI State -> Zustand

Transient global state related to the UI (e.g., `isSidebarVisible`, `isCommandPaletteOpen`) uses small, slices Zustand stores for different UI domains (e.g., `useMainUIStore.ts`, `useMyFancyFeaturePanelStore.ts`).

### All Persisted State -> Tanstack Query

Data that originates from outside of the react app, either from the Rust backend (eg read from disk) or from external services and APIs uses TanStack Query. Use **TanStack Query**. All `invoke` calls should be wrapped in `useQuery` or `useMutation` hooks within the `src/services/` directory. This handles loading, error, and caching states automatically.

### Data on local disk

Certain settings data should be persisted to local storage (in addition to or instead of to any remote backend system). This should usually be written to the applications support directory (eg. ``~/Library/Application Support/com.myapp.app/recovery/` on macOS). This is handled by Tauri's [filesystem plugin](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/file-system/) and should be accessed and written in the same way as any other state which is not "owned" by the React App... ie via Tanstack Query.

## Command Bridge

- **Tauri -> React:** In `main.rs`, define your menu items. When a menu item is clicked, emit an event to the frontend (e.g., `window.emit('menu-event', 'new-file')`). Create a `useMenuListeners.ts` hook in React to listen for these events and call the appropriate functions.
- **React -> Tauri:** Create a command `update_menu_item(id: String, state: MenuItemState)` in Rust. In React, you can call `invoke('update_menu_item', ...)` to enable/disable menu items based on application state (e.g., disable "Save" when `isDirty` is false).
- **Command System:** Create a `lib/commands.ts` file that defines a global command registry. This allows different parts of the app to register and execute commands (e.g., "createNewFile", "toggleTheme") without being directly coupled. The Command Palette and menu listeners can then simply execute commands from this registry.

## Test Framework

- Rust tests live inside the Rust test files in accordance with Rust best practices.
- Other tests are written using vitest and `@testing-library/react` and are colocated with the files they test. Setup, utilities, hooks etc are in `test/` within the relevant `src` directory.

## Styling & UI Components

### Tailwind & shadcn

- Tailwind 4 is used alongside shadcn 4 UI components in the standard way
- UI components are installed in `src/components/ui` and are kebab-case. Generally speaking, they should not be modified heavily **unless** you are modifying their visual appearance.
- Most styling for JSX componenrs should be done with tailwind to keep things simple.
- A shadcn theme can be generated with [Tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/) and should be used to provide a basic theme via CSS variables.

### Themeing

Themeing should be done via [Tailwind v4 CSS variables](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) and an [ThemeProvider](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/vite). See also <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme>.

### CSS

Since we're using Tailwind, there should be very little CSS. Some very complex components _may_ include a `MyComponent.css` but it should be extremely rare. In general, the only CSS should be in `App.css` (loaded by `App.tsx`). This includes:

- Font imports
- Tailwind theme variables
- Other CSS variables
- Tailwind & shadcn initialisation
- Some basic resets to make things work more like a macOS app.
  - Resets to prevent scrolling and overflows.
  - Styling for Tauri windows.
  - Cursor is never a pointer, except on plain text links or when overriden with a utility class
  - No text selection by default, except where overriden or in inputs and textareas.

## React Components System

- Each React component should be in its own `.tsx` file.
- If a component has any non-trivial logic (e.g., `useEffect`, state management, complex event handlers), extract it into a custom hook (e.g., `useFileRenaming.ts`). The component should be left with primarily presentational code.
- All component directories should contain barrel exports.

## Main Window Layout

### `main.tsx`

Renders `<App />` wrapped in the Tanstack `QuertProvider`. Nothing else.

### `App.tsx`

Contains auto-update logic and Renders `<MainWindow />` wrapped in `<ThemeProvider>`. Should contain no other logic.

### MainWindow

This is the primary container for the react app. It should render the main app layout components as well as any global "hidden" components like Toasts, Dialogs, command palette etc. By default, it contains four visible components (TitleBar, LeftSideBar, MainWindowContent and RightSideBar) and three invisible ones (PreferencesDialig, CommandPallete, Toaster) as well as hooks for using any stored global UI state. The sidebars and main content components are wrapped in shadcn's ResizablePanel system.

### TitleBar

A unified title bar which spans the entire top of the app and is clickable to drag the window around (using `data-tauri-drag-region`). The left side contains a component which renders a custom version of Mac OS "traffic light" Window controls. The rest of the toolbar is ready for minimal buttons to be added to the left or right side of it.

### LeftSideBar

The left sidebar is a simple wrapper whose only purpose is to constrain any other components it contains, and to allow itself to be resized or hidden.

### RightSideBar

The right sidebar is a simple wrapper whose only purpose is to constrain any other components it contains, and to allow itself to be resized or hidden.

### MainWindowContent

The main content window is a simple wrapper that allows for the conditional rendering of other components in the main window. In apps where this isn't required, this component can be replaced with whatever the main window should contain.

## Preferences System

This is intended to provide a simple and obvious pattern for adding settings and configurations. It can be opened with a keyboard shortcut or from the macOS menubar. The left-hand side contains a number of "tabs" Built using shadcn's `Sidebar` components. Each tab loads a new **pane** into the right-hand side. Panes can be added to `src/components/preferences/panes`.

Preferences should be persisted using the standard hooks and pattern for interacting with any other persistent data via Tanstack Query.

## Command Palette

The command palette provides a simple overlay with easy keyboard navigability using Shadcn's `command` components. By default, the only command is to open the preferences, Which provides an example of how to fire commands from the palette.

## Native Menu System

The native menu system provides the following through Tauri's menu systems:

- Main Menu
  - About -> Shows a native dialog with some basic info about the app, version etc
  - Check for Updates -> Fires the auto=-update checker
  - Preferences -> Opens the preferences dialog
  - Quit -> Quits the app
- Window
  - Enter Full Screen Mode -> Enters macOS fullscreen mode

There is an obvious and easy-to-follow pattern for adding new menu items along with their associated keyboard shortcuts, and for those to fire commands as you would expect.

## Keyboard Shortcuts System

Global keyboard shortcuts are managed by `react-hotkeys-hook` inside an event listners hookwhich is loaded by `MainWindow`. These shortcuts fire events in the same pattern as everywhere else.

## Local Filesystem Access

This app is pre-configured with the Tauri file system access, along with the necessary security measures to deny access to important places on the local file system. This is primarily used to read and write preferences persisted to disc, but it also makes it easy to build apps which need to read and write to the local file system.

## Local Settings Persistance & Crash Reporting

Local preferences are persisted to disc in the application's support directory as JSON files. There is also a pre-built mechanism for writing crash reports to this directory along with any potentially unsaved data which could not be properly written/synced to remote stores.

## Release Process

- GitHub Action to create release from github tags, along with JSON file to enable auto-updates.
- `scripts/prepare-release.js` to assist with preparing and pushing a new release.
- Release process documented in `docs/developer/releases.md` along with instructions for setting up the GitHub action correctly.

## Auto-Updator

- Auto-update mechanism which checks github for new releases on launch (or when "Check fo Updates" is clicked and installs and relaunches the application). This uses `tauri-plugin-process` and [updater](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/), and Tauri standard practices for doing this.

## Toast & Notification System

Notifications to be sent and displayed as toasts in the bottom right of the application and/or be sent to the native macOS notifications via Tauri's [Notifications](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/notification/) system. Toasts disappear after a set time and are stylable and dismissible by the user. Notifications can be dispatched either from React or Rust code via easy-to-use helper functions which control the destinations (toast, native), type and content.

## Logging System

Logging helpers are provided in both Rust and TypeScript To facilitate easy logging, both to the JavaScript console and to The macOS logs via Tauri's [log plugin](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/logging/).

## Developer Docs

The philosophy, design patterns, architecture, best practises, and development processes are documented in a series of Markdown files in `docs/developer`. This is intended as a starting point, describing the current setup. As new features are added and new patterns are included, these documents should be added to and updated so they remain current.

`docs/architecture-guide.md` is a comprihensive set of instructions on the patterns and rules used in this app. It's intended for AI agents to read when checking their work follows established patterns.

## User Guide Boilerplate

A Bare Bones User Guide is included in `docs/userguide`. As new user-facing features are added, this user guide should be updated. The Markdown files in here can be used to build an online user guide if needed.

## Task Management

A simple Markdown-based task manager system is included.

`docs/tasks-done` - Completed tasks as markdown files
`docs/tasks-todo` - Uncompleted tasks as markdown files
`docs/tasks.md` - Instructions for AI agents (and humans) about how to manage tasks.

Tasks take the form `task-x-taskname.md`. To prioritise a task, change the "x" to a number. Any with "x" are unprioritised and "on the backlog".

## AI Dev Tooling

### AI Instructions

A comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` is included, along with barebones cursor rules and `GEMINI.md` which simply point at claude's instructions.

### Claude Code Agents

Five Claude Code agents specific to this project are included:

- UI Designer -> Expert & passionate UI designer with 15 years experience building native-feeling desktop apps using web technology. Knows macOS design inside out and is expert at making Tauri/React apps beatiful and joyful to use. Equally great at tailwind and modern CSS, with a deep understanding of how React components should be composed to create beautiful, accessible and delightful UIs. Always sweats the details.
- Tauri Genius -> World expert on the inner workings of Tauri and it's plugin ecosystem and highly skilled Rust engineer. Knows the JS/TS parts of Tauri as well as the rust parts.
- React Genius -> World Expert at writing clean, performant and maintainable front-end systems with _exactly our stack_.
- Technical writer -> Expert at writing clear, terse, unambiguous and information-dense technical docs about THIS PROJECT which are INCREDIBLE at helping both human and AI coders **really understand** the mental models and patterns required to work easily in this codebase. They know the codebase inside-out but only document the stuff their readers **need**. Their docs are so good at explaining the patterns, mental models and Weird Bits that people new to the project always say "it normally takes months of mistakes before I really get a codebase. These docs made that instant". Owns everything in `/docs/developer` and contributes to other technical docs as needed.
- User Guide Writer -> Thirty years experience writing AMAZING guides for end users of technical software. The hardest part of this job is balancing "compelling", "complete", "correct", "engaging", "concise" and "clear". And this agent is KNOWN for being great at that. They know the product and it's users inside-out. When a diagram, screenshot or video is better than words, they ask a human for help... clearly explaining what they need. They are responsible for `docs/userguide` and nothing else.

### Claude Code Commands

One Claude Code Command is included. You should create moreas your product evolves.

- `/check` -> Checks everything meets `docs/architecture-guide.css` , runs `npm run check:all` and fixes any problems.
